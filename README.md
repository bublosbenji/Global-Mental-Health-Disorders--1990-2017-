# Global Mental Health Disorders (1990-2017) 

The project "Global Mental Health Disorders (1990-2017)" offers a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of key mental health disorders across different countries, spanning from 1990 to 2017. Utilizing a dataset that merges multiple sources, the project employs rigorous data extraction, cleaning, and exploration techniques to shed light on the global patterns and implications of mental health disorders. The project's goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how mental health conditions affect populations worldwide, identify trends, and underscore the significance of addressing mental health as a critical component of public health.

### Key Tools and Methodologies:
**Data Extraction and Cleaning:** Utilized Python libraries such as pandas and numpy to merge, clean, and prepare the dataset for analysis. This step was crucial for ensuring data quality and reliability.
<br>
**Data Exploration and Analysis:** Employed statistical analysis and visualization techniques to explore the dataset comprehensively. This included analyzing the prevalence rates of various mental health disorders, examining demographic disparities, and identifying correlations between different conditions and their impact on public health.

### Main Findings and Insights:
**Prevalence by Disorder:** Analysis revealed specific countries with the highest prevalence rates for disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, drug use disorders, depression, and alcohol use disorders. For example, the United States showed high prevalence rates for drug use disorders, while New Zealand and Australia appeared frequently across different disorders, indicating a broad impact of mental health conditions.
<br>
**Gender Disparities:** The mean prevalence of mental health disorders was higher in females (approximately 4.16%) compared to males (approximately 2.81%), with greater variability among females. Anxiety disorders and depression were notably more prevalent among females.
<br>
**Correlations Between Disorders:** The analysis identified strong positive correlations between eating disorders and schizophrenia (0.71) and bipolar disorder (0.72), suggesting interconnectedness between these conditions. Moderate positive correlations were observed between anxiety disorders and other mental health conditions, indicating a complex relationship between various disorders.
<br>
**Suicide Rates:** A positive correlation was found between suicide rates and the prevalence of depression (0.40) and alcohol use disorders (0.47), highlighting the severe implications of these conditions on public health.

### Limitations:
The dataset does not extend beyond 2017, limiting the ability to assess the impact of recent global events on mental health trends.

### Conclusion and Implications:
"Global Mental Health Disorders (1990-2017)" provides valuable insights into the prevalence and impact of mental health disorders globally, emphasizing the importance of mental health awareness and intervention. The findings underscore the need for accessible mental health services and the importance of continued research and data collection to understand and address the evolving landscape of global mental health. The project highlights the critical role of mental health in public health and the necessity of addressing mental health disorders as a global priority.
